Fun side projects. Always improving.

Each mini project will have a description in this ever-evolving README.

query_bitcoin.py: I used SQL to simply query the StackExchange Data Dump that use the string "bitcoin" in the title or tags. This portion of the script is commented out, since it's quite minimal- I am primarily using Python for the remainder of the mini project, which involves attractively displaying something interesting about my query results.

LPTHW*: files associated with Z. Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way". I've learned Python on an as-needed basis and am reviewing the fundamentals of the language.

Kaggle_random_forest_sales.ipynb: I am following the 2018 fast.ai ML UCSF course. This notebook details my first independent attempt at creating a simple random forest regressor to predict housing sales (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
